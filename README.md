# Project: Data Modeling and ETL with Postgres and Python
## Project Description

A compagny that has been collecting songs' data and users activity wants an efficient model to store and analyze the data. The data currently resides in AWS S3 bucket in JSON format.
This project consists of building an ETL pipeline that extracts the data from S3, processing using apache Spark, and loads back to AWS S3 in parquet format.
This will help the analytics to analyze and derive insights from data.

## Data description
There are two sources of dataset, the **Song Dataset** and the **Log Dataset** .  Both dataset are currently stored in amazon S3. These files will be read from Spark and stored in some staging tables. Then another process will extract the data from staging tables and load in final final files in S3.

### The Song Dataset
The song data is stored at : `s3://udacity-dend/song_data`  
This is a collection of JSON data that store songs data. The files are partitioned by the three letters of of each song's track ID. These are two examples:

 - **song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json**
 - **song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json**
 
 Each file is structured as:
 
 {"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}

### Log Dataset

The Log dataset is stored at `Log data: s3://udacity-dend/log_data` and the JSON path is `s3://udacity-dend/log_data`.

The second dataset is a set of JSON log files generated by an event similator base of songs dataset above. These files simulate activity logs partitioned by year and month as we can see below:

- **log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json**
- **log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json**

The file is structured as :

## Choice of Data Model

For this project, we will building a star model with fact and dimension tables. This schema is analytic focus as all dimensions tables are one join away from that fact tables that easier queries retrieval. Here is tables description:

### statging tables structure
 The staging tables will store all fields as they are from the files in S3
 - **staging events table** 
 'staging_events
    artist    
    auth      
    firstName 
    gender    
    itemInSession 
    lastName  
    length    
    level 
    location
    method 
    page 
    registration 
    sessionId 
    song 
    status igint,
    ts  
    userAgent 
    userId  
 '
 - **staging songs tables**
 ` staging_songs
     num_songs 
     artist_id
     artist_latitude 
     artist_longitude
     artist_location 
     artist_name 
     song_id 
     title 
     duration
     year
     `
### Final tables

**Fact Table**

    1 - songplays - records in log data associated with song plays i.e. records with page NextSong
         songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent
         
**Dimension Tables**

    2 - users - users in the app
         user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level 
    3 - songs - songs in music database
         song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration
    4- artists - artists in music database
        artist_id, name, location, latitude, longitude
    5- time - timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units
        start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday

 ## Project Structure
 
 The project has two main files, here is the description:
 
 1 - `etl.py` :  reads and processes files from song_data and log_data and loads them into different tables structure as described above, then write them bas in AWS S3.
 
 5 - `dl.cfg` : contains a valid user access key and secret key that has access to source bucket in S3.

## Installation 

- Install python 3.8
- Clone the current repository 
- create IAM user in AWS and get the user access key and secret key
- Add IAM access and secret keys to dl.cfg file.
- Open command line and move to the repository folder
- Run the `etl.py` file to read, extract, transform and load data to different tables

## Examples of Queries

- **First 10 artists:** 

 `select * from artists  where  limit 10;`

 **Result:**

- **10 most popular artists:**

`SELECT name as  artist_name ,COUNT(DISTINCT session_id) as play_count
 FROM songplays s
 JOIN artists a ON a.artist_id = s.artist_id
 WHERE level='paid'
 GROUP BY name
 ORDER BY play_count DESC
 LIMIT 10;
`

**Result**:
